This is a very simple script.  It adds a Sessions menu to gvim. Using the menu you can save and restore sessions. Sessions are saved in ~/.vim/sessions by default. In case you need further clarification, see the screenshot:

For those who don't know, sessions allow you to save the state of your current Vim session to a file. You can then :source the session file to resume state. see :h mks for more information.
